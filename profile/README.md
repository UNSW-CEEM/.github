# UNSW CEEM GitHub Page

The [**Collaboration on Energy and Environmental Markets (CEEM)**](https://www.ceem.unsw.edu.au/) at the University of New South Wales undertakes interdisciplinary research in the design, analysis and performance of energy and environmental markets and their associated policy frameworks. 

CEEM brings together UNSW researchers from a number of Faculties, working together to address key challenges for energy transition applying engineering, economic, business, policy, social and legal perspectives and tools. It is particularly keen to promote open data and open source tools that allow a wide range of interested stakeholders to contribute to successful Australian and global energy transition. 

This GitHub organisation hosts software, including open source tools, created by UNSW CEEM researchers.

## NEM Tools

Tools related to the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM)

### Data

#### [NEMOSIS](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/NEMOSIS)
- A Python package for downloading historical data published by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). Data avaliable includes energy and FCAS market prices, regional demand and generation summaries, generator dispatch targets and SCADA, interconnector flows and losses, generator bids, and generic constraint formulations and marginal values.

#### [NEMSEER](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/NEMSEER)
- A Python package for downloading and handling historical National Electricity Market (NEM) forecast data (5MPD, PD, PDPASA, STPASA and MTPASA) produced by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).

#### [NEMED](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/NEMED)
- Desc

### Modelling

#### [nempy](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/nempy)
- Nempy is a Python package for modelling the dispatch procedure of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). It can be used to formulate very simple dispatch models, or more complex ones by adding features such as ramping constraints, interconnectors, FCAS markets and more.
