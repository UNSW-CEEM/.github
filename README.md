The **Collaboration on Energy and Environmental Markets (CEEM)** at the University of New South Wales undertakes interdisciplinary research in the design, analysis and performance of energy and environmental markets and their associated policy frameworks. 

CEEM brings together UNSW researchers from the UNSW Business School (was the Australian School of Business), the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, the Institute of Environmental Studies, and the Faculty of Law, working alongside a growing number of international partners.
